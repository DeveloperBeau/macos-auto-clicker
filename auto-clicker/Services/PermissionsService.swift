// I had a lot of problems getting all this setup so that the Accessibility permissions were clear and prompted to the user.
// macOS and Xcode have some 'interesting' quirks that impeade the development of this. Mainly that Xcode by default will run
//  in sandboxed mode, meaning native macOS permissions prompts won't fire until thats dissabled in the applications entitlements
//  file. The other is that macOS will not reset or apply the permissions to a new build of the app as the app signature changes
//  for each build, which makes sense but its annoying there isn't a way to automate this during development. The only 'solution'
//  I have yet found is to just use `tccutil` to reset the permissions for the $PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER as an Xcode build script
//  with the annoyance being that you have to apply the permissions on each app build...
